# Automation-World
This is a list of automation projects that make life just a little bit easier and sometimes a lot more easier 

#1. Yelp 
I am a foodie! and if you are too then you i wrote a little program that makes it just a little bit easier to search for food in yelp. What would Normally take 2 or 3 steps now takes 1. 
I have the python script which directly goes to yelp and finds the restaurant or type of food i am looking for 
and the Bash script which executes the python script. 
FEW THINGS TO NOTE: 
a. If you wish to get this to run on your computer, make sure you change the directory of the yelp.py in yelp.bat to match where you
saved it.
b. if you add the directory of the bash script to the environment path of your computer, then all you need to do to is open the windows command window ("windows button + r"), 
then enter into the command window "yelp <name of food or restuarant>"
and click enter. 
And you should be stirring at your food of choice at any moment. 



#2. SALE NOTIFICATION FOR ALL THE STUFF YOU WISH TO BUY ON DIFFERENT WEBSITES.  

In preparation of christmas shopping, you can create a python script that would pull the price of shoes (or anything else you wish to buy) from different websites, that way you will know which item goes on sale without having to go check the websites yourself.
Again i have done this in a 2 step process. A python script and a bash script to call the python script. 
If you do want to go directly to the website, you simply enter yes if you want to and you will be redirected accordlingly. ENJOY!


#3. SONG ! 

I don't like too many songs so when i find few i like, i go crazy and put it on replay. 
I typically use youtube when i am at work to listen to music but its so annoying youtube doesn't have 
a replay button and i have to stop my work to hit 'back/rewind' before the new starts sings. 
NO MORE! i Wrote some code that would replay my fav song for me :) 
Another boring task automated! 
#p.s After i wrote this code, then i found out youtube has a somewhat hidden "loop" button that repeat songs for us 
#but i am still going to use my solutuon *shrugs*
